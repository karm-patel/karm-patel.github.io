## About
I am a final year undergraduate student at [VGEC, Chandkheda](https://www.vgecg.ac.in/). My major branch is **Computer Engineering** and area of interest is Data science and Machine  learning. 

Currently I am doing final year internship in [IIT Gandhinagar](https://www.iitgn.ac.in/) under [Prof. Nipun Batra](https://nipunbatra.github.io/). Where I'm exploring the probabilistic machine learning and contributing to [pyprobml](https://github.com/probml/pyprobml) repo. This repo contains source code to reproduce the figure in [books](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/) written by [Dr. Kevin Murphy](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/). Where I'm trying to contribute in refactoring the codebase ([example PR](https://github.com/probml/pyprobml/pull/807)) , improving figures quality ([example PR](https://github.com/probml/pyprobml/pull/713)), adding interactive demo for figures, and converting existing code from other Python frameworks (Torch, Pymc, etc) to JAX ([example PR](https://github.com/probml/pyprobml/issues/694#issuecomment-1095150779)).
