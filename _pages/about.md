## About
I am a final year undergraduate student at [VGEC, Chandkheda](https://www.vgecg.ac.in/). My major branch is **Computer Engineering** and area of interest is Data science and Machine  learning.

Currently I am doing final year internship in [IIT Gandhinagar](https://www.iitgn.ac.in/) under [Prof. Nipun Batra](https://nipunbatra.github.io/). Where I'm exploring about Probablistic Machine learning.
