## About
I have recently completed my B.E. in CSE at [VGEC, Chandkheda](https://www.vgecg.ac.in/). Now I'll be joining [IISc Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/) on 18th July for M.Tech, Compuer Science.

Currently, I am a **GSoC'22 contributor** (TensorFlow team) under mentors [Dr. Kevin Murphy](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/) and [Prof. Nipun Batra](https://nipunbatra.github.io/). Where I'm exploring the algorithms of probabilistic machine learning and contributing to [pyprobml](https://github.com/probml/pyprobml) repo. This repo contains source code to reproduce the figure in [books](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/) written by Dr. Kevin Murphy. Where I'm contributing in refactoring the codebase ([example PR](https://github.com/probml/pyprobml/pull/807)), improving figures quality ([example PR](https://github.com/probml/pyprobml/pull/713)), adding interactive demo for figures, and converting existing code from other Python frameworks (Torch, Pymc, etc) to JAX ([example PR](https://github.com/probml/pyprobml/issues/694#issuecomment-1095150779)).
