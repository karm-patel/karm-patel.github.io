## Projects 

### 1. Attendance System using Face Recognition(ML,Python, Flask, SQL)
MAR 21 - MAY 21, [Github](https://github.com/Attendance-Using-Face-Recognition/Online-Attendance-Using_Face-Recognition.git)

- **Web**: Flask-based web application that provides functionalities such as taking attendance using face recognition, downloading attendance, adding lectures.

- **Face recognition**: In this [blog](https://karm216.github.io/Fastpages-Notebooks/fastpages/jupyter/2021/03/25/face_recognization.html) I implemented face recognition part. I have used the **Caffe** model to detect a face, the **FaceNet** model to get face embeddings & the **SVM** model to classify faces. 
- **Database**: I have used local MySQL database to store attendance records of students.

### 2. Vaccine Slot Notifier (Web scrapping, Python, Flask, AWS EC2)

MAY 21, [Github](https://github.com/karm216/Vaccine-Slot-Notifier.git)

I made this project when Indian government started vaccination drive. But due to uncertain time in updating vaccination slot, one had to check [cowin](https://www.cowin.gov.in/) portal continously. I made this application to help people to get notification of vaccine slot when slot is available. Around more than **200 people** registered on this website.

- **Web**: I deployed a Live Web application (using flask) on AWS Ec2 instance which collects the necessary details of a user & notifies him/her via email when a vaccine slot is available in his/her area.

- **Web scrapper**: I made Web-Scrapper using **requests & a beautiful soap** python library which continuously scrapes data from the Cowin website.
  
I made [command line application](https://github.com/karm216/Vaccine-Slot-Notifier-Single-user) also, if user wants to run script on personal PC to reduce gap between actual slot updation time and notification time.
