## Major Projects 

### 1. Attendance‌ ‌System‌ ‌using‌ ‌Face‌         ‌Recognition (Python, ML, Flask, SQL)
MAR‌ ‌21‌ ‌-‌ ‌MAY‌ ‌21 </br>

- **Web**: Flask-based web application that provides functionalities such as taking attendance using face recognition, downloading attendance, adding lectures.

- **Face recognition**: In this [blog](https://karm216.github.io/Fastpages-Notebooks/fastpages/jupyter/2021/03/25/face_recognization.html) I implemented face recognition part. I have used the **Caffe** model to detect a face, the **FaceNet** model to get face embeddings & the **SVM** model to classify faces. 
- **Database**: I have used local MySQL database to store attendance records of students.
